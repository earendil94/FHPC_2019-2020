Yet another I/O openmpi lesson.

Lock mechanism: if a process is performing some stuff on a file the file is locked for other processes.
2 separated calls: need to reset the pointer each and every time. Or open/close the file every time.

The stride in mpi I/O is defined as the total amount of blocks in between one another.
In Cozzini Fortran example the right amount is 8.
