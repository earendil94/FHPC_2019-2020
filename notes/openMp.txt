#pragam omp parallel
{
	foo(...)

}

This is actually calling a parallel region: ALL THE THREADS WILL EXECUTE FOO

#ifdef _OPENMP

This lets you write some part of the code to be executed only if you compile with -fopenmp

stuff defined outside of the parallel region: shared
stuff defined inside the parallel region: private

#pragma master: makes the following block to be executed only by the master thread

We talk about memory race when more threads are requesting to write on the same memory region.
