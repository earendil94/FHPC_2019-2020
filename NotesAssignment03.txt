Let's describe the problem in multiple steps, first from an abstract perspective, then from 
a more low-level one.

1) We do the program in C. We create two struct as suggested by Luca

    - struct vect
    - struct point

2) We define a function that returns an array of point with random position and velocities
    and we save this array in the shared memory of our program.
    Each MPI task has to generate Np/N particles and each one must then read the remaining N - Np/N,
    since every process needs to have them in memory.
    We might want to save the generated particles in a vector and the external ones in another vector

2.b) We might also want to actually do a serial version of this code for speedup comparison,
    maybe we should start from this.
