Regarding the assignment

Ex0:

1) We first assume that time_to_solution := the actual time difference already measured in the program
2) I honestly think we can do better than the e metric for parallel overhead. 
    We can for example calculate the time spent on the "parallelizable" part of code during the serial
    Run and then compare it.
3) Here it must be some kind of papi metrics. Maybe best way is to use perf for preliminary analysis?
    Maybe actually not since we would need to specify events also there. So maybe a good first start
    is to use the events we already saw in other papi codes.

Attack plan:

PreMonday: Try to run the code on ulysses without papi calls and stuff, see if it works. Collect information
    about output structure.

Monday: Build a shell that executes a job on ulysses launching our code and collecting the information we need
    (will need to be updated after the papi modification).

Tuesday:
